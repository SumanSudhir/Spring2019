<h2>Some Proposed Projects</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Monocular SLAM</b> For details look at this <a href= "https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ab9515/introductiontomonocular.html"> link </a>
<li><b>Bokeh(Depth of field) effect with a single camera <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">(link): </b></a>Nowadays many mobile camera have "portrait mode", as they call it, which generates a synthetic depth of field effect. This is generally done using a dual camera design. Your challenge is to do it using a single camera image.
<li><b>Simulating depth of field using stereo images:</b> Same as 1 but this time you have pair of sterio images, get the dataset from here <a href="http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/2014/">link</a>
<li><b>Evaluating handwritten mathematical expressions:</b> From a picture of a handwritten mathematical expression, your algorithm should recognize the expression and evaluate it.
<li><b>End-to-End License Plate Detection and Recognition:</b> Build an automated pipeline to acquire registration plate from images of vehicle and do OCR on them. For example look at <a href = "http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Zhenbo_Xu_Towards_End-to-End_License_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf" >this paper </a>
<li><b>Plane extraction on surfaces:</b> Track a section of a plane so that a user can place a 3D object on the surface, for augmented reality applications.
<li><p><b>Glyph based AR application:</b> Images below depict typical glyphs. You job is to develop an appication which tracks these glyphs, computes homography, and overlays 3D graphics over it, as in typical AR application.</p><p align="center"> <img src="glyphs_sample.png"></p>
<li><b>Barrel distortion estimation and removal:</b> 
<li><b>Tracking objects using mean shift:</b> Associated paper <a href="http://comaniciu.net/Papers/MsTracking.pdf">link</a>
<li><b>Street sign translation:</b> Taking images of street signs and translating the text, as found in Google goggles, translate or World Lens(now defunct).
<li><b>Face detection using CNN:</b> Creating and training CNN model to output bounding box for faces in images.
<li><b>Whale recognition (Kaggle Challenge):</b> Take a look at this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-right-whale-recognition">link</a>
<li><b>Style transfer:</b> Transfer the style of a Van Gogh or your favorite artist to any other photograph or artwork <a href="http://genekogan.com/images/style-transfer/ml_cubist_expressionist_impressionist.jpg">link</a>
<li><b>Neural Network Compression:</b> Though Neural networks achieve state-of-the-art results for most computer vision prolems, running them on low power embedded devices in real time is still a major challenge that the industry is facing. In this project, you will take a standard network (say ResNet-50) and try to make it more compute, bandwidth and memory effitient which not compromising on the quality of the generated results  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00149">link</a>.
