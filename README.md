<h2>Learning materials and textbooks</h2>
<ul>
<li> Lecture slides that will be regularly posted
<li><a href="http://szeliski.org/Book/">Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications</a>, by Richard Szeliski</li>
<li><a href="http://crcv.ucf.edu/gauss/BOOK.PDF">Fundamentals of Computer Vision</a>, by Mubarak Shah</li>
<li> <a href = "http://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learning</a>, by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville 
<li> All <a href="https://github.com/facebook/iTorch">iTorch</a> notebooks for topics covered in class can be found <a href="https://github.com/cs763-dl/2017Spring/tree/master/Notebooks">here</a>
</ul>

<h2>Grading Policy</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Mid-sem exam: 20%
	<li>Final exam (cumulative): 20%
	<li>Assignments (five or six): 35% (all to be done in groups of 2-3 students)
	<li>Course project: 20% (to be done in the same group of 2-3 students)
	<li>Class participation: 5%
	<li>Course project work will be presented by the student group during a viva at the end of the course. During this viva, each student in the group will be separately questioned, not only on the project work, but also the assignments. Each student is expected to contribute to each and every assignment and the course project. 
	<li>Audit requirements: You must write both exams, submit all assignments and the project, and score at least 40% to get an AU.
</ul>

<h2>Other Policies</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Assignments will be given out (typically) once every two or three weeks. They must be submitted on or before the deadline. No late assignments will be accepted. The programming components of the assignments will typically involve MATLAB and lua, so you must be willing to learn it quickly.
	<li><b>We will adopt a zero-tolerance policy against any forms of plagiarism or any other form of cheating. Just don't do it! In cases of plagiarism, givers and takers will both be considered equally responsible.</b>
	<li>This course is (inherently) cumulative. The syllabus for the final exam will include everything taught during the semester.
</ul>

<h2>Course Projects</h2>
As mentioned in the grading policy, this course has a project requirement which will be 20% of your grade. The project needs to be done in a group of 2-3 students. We will send out a form which needs to be filled up with your project proposal. For a list of projects, please check <a href="https://github.com/cs763/Spring2019/tree/master/projects">this link</a>

<h2>Assignments</h2>
There will be 7-8 assignments in this course. They will be a mix of theoretical and programming questions.
